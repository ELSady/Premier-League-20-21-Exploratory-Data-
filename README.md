* England has the most players out of any nations, not surprising to the very least, it is their local league after all. Followed by their European compatriots, like France, Spain, Portugal and Scotland having the most players after England. Whats interesting is, Brazil, a non European nation is also in the mix of having the most players in the league.

### Age distribution of Each Club

* Manchester City when it comes to amount of goals scored truly comes clear ahead of any other clubs in the league, then followed by Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspurs and Liverpool respectively. Sheffield United and Fullham did relegated to the 2nd tier of English Football for the next campaign and the number of golas are clear evident of their performance this season.

* Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea the top 3 teams having the most passes attempted out of any other clubs. Considering how the managers for each of these 3 club set up their team to play possesion based football. The team which can preserve possesion of the ball are the ones controlling the match and very likely to score goals. Manchester City on the top when it come to goals, it is hardly a surprise.
