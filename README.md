* England has the most players out of any nations, not surprising to the very least, it is their local league after all. Followed by their European compatriots, like France, Spain, Portugal and Scotland having the most players after England. Whats interesting is, Brazil, a non European nation is also in the mix of having the most players in the league.

### Age distribution of Each Club

* Manchester United having the luxury of the youngest squad in the league, they certainly have a bright future stars ahead of them. Followed by Leicester City, Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers. In contrast, Crystal Palace, having the oldest age squad, have not rejuvenate their squad.

### Total Goals Scored for Each Club

* Manchester City when it comes to amount of goals scored truly comes clear ahead of any other clubs in the league, then followed by Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspurs and Liverpool respectively. Sheffield United and Fullham did relegated to the 2nd tier of English Football for the next campaign and the number of golas are clear evident of their performance this season.

### Total Passes Attempted for Each Club

* Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea the top 3 teams having the most passes attempted out of any other clubs. Considering how the managers for each of these 3 club set up their team to play possesion based football. The team which can preserve possesion of the ball are the ones controlling the match and very likely to score goals. Manchester City on the top when it come to goals, it is hardly a surprise.

### Conclusion
* The number of players for each positon is not very balanced, Midfield and Forward ideally should have greater number than Defender.
* The Age for this English Premier League campaign is very well distributed, majority players are at te age of 26 to 30.
* Manchester United have the youngest squad.
* The League has many england players than any other nations, is is reasonable considering it is their local league.
* Forwards scoring goals as expected.
* Manchester City have both the most Total Goals and Open Goals.
* Harry Kane is both Top Goals scorer and Assister.
* Bruno Fernandes has the highest Penalty converter.
* Defenders have the most passes attempted and touches of the ball.
* Aston Villa is the most agresive club, having the most total cards for yellow and red combined.
